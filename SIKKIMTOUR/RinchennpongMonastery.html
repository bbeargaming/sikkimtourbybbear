is a well-known tourist spot in&nbsp;West Sikkim,
because of the view of the mountain ranges seen from here. It is also a
place famous for 2 of the oldest monasteries in Sikkim,&nbsp;Reesum
Monastery&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rinchenpong Monastery. Both were built
around 17th to
18th century.&nbsp;Rinchenpong Monastery&nbsp;is
the 3rd oldest monastery in Sikkim, starting with around 98 lamas.[2]
The monastery houses a rare Ati Buddha (Adi-Buddha) statue in the
Yab-Yum position. Ati Buddha, also termed as The Primordial Buddha is
said to be the true Buddha, symbolically represented as a naked Buddha
in blue. In the Yab-Yum position, the Buddha is shown meditating while
embracing a woman. In Buddhism it signifies the power of union of the
male and female.[3]</p>

is even said that the&nbsp;1913
Nobel&nbsp;laureate&nbsp;Rabindranath Tagore&nbsp;once
visited this place and wrote a poem for his book&nbsp;Gitanjali,
titled&nbsp;Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo, later translated to English by
him
titled&nbsp;Where The Mind Is Without Fear. There is a viewpoint
above
Rinchen Chholing Monastery, named&nbsp;Rabindra Smriti
Van&nbsp;honoured in the
name of him. This viewpoint is filled
with&nbsp;Rhododendron&nbsp;and some other
seasonal flowers.</p>
<span style="color: red;">The
tourism scene is active here since 2005 to 2006. The two of the oldest
hotels here are&nbsp;Hotel Norlha&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hotel
Rinchenpong Nest.
It is a silent scenic place for everyone to quit from there busy life
and stay for a couple of days for the refreshment. One can see the
majestic view of
Mount&nbsp;Kangchenjunga,&nbsp;Kabru,&nbsp;Mount
Pandim&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kumbhakarna Mountain&nbsp;from here</span></td>

<td style="background-color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"><span style="color: yellow;">In 1860 the British sent an
expeditionary force to Sikkim. When the force reached Rinchenpong the
Lapchas (the original inhabitants of Sikkim) used herbs to poison the
water of a pond, the only source of water in Rinchenpong, thus killing
half of the British forces and forcing them to beat a retreat.</span><br style="color: yellow;">
<br style="color: yellow;">
<span style="color: yellow;">The pond was christened
Poison Pokhri, making it one of the earliest examples of bio-chemical
warfare, and can still be seen in Rinchenpong. Sadly the small, almost
dry pond is nothing impressive, but don&#8217;t be disheartened.</span><br style="color: yellow;">
<br style="color: yellow;">
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: yellow;">The mountain views of Rinchenpong are
as fascinating as those of Darjeeling, Gantok or Pelling. So if you are
tired of viewing Kanchenjunga above a crowded cityscape then pack your
bags and head for Rinchenpong, but don&#8217;t be late as unplanned tourism
can soon turn it into another crowded, dirty hill-station. Apart from
great mountain views,Rinchenpong has something more to offer. A series
of winding stone-paved trails lead one past Lapcha traditional houses
and old British forest bungalows to ancient monasteries, housing rare
idols. The trail passes through beautiful forest, with the snowy peaks
of Himalayas towering above the treetops.</span><br style="color: yellow;">
</div>
<span style="color: yellow;">For the most
comfortable journey take the night bus / train to Siliguri / New
Jalpaiguri. From Siliguri jeeps are available to Rinchenpong via
Jorethang. The 130kms journey takes about 5 hours and passes along the
banks of Teesta and Rangit Rivers and beneath a canopy of lush green
trees.You will be in Rinchenpong by evening and check in at one of the
few h</span><span style="color: yellow;">otels that
dot the bazaar area. Next morning you will be greeted by a spectacular
sunrise on Kanchenjunga and its sister peaks. One by one Kanchenjunga,
Rathong, Kabru, Kumbhakarna, Pandim, etc. will catch the crimson rays
of the rising sun turning the entire massive range into a bright shade
of scarlet. Try to get a room with a mountain-view, so that you can
enjoy the entire spectacle from the warmth of your room. But i</span><span style="color: yellow;">f you
can&#8217;t manage one simply rush to the rooftop, where the crisp cool
morning air will refresh you for the long walks ahead.</span><br style="color: yellow;">
<span style="color: yellow;">After a quick filling
breakfast, follow the step road from the bazaar which takes you to the
banks of the Poison Pokhri. Just opposite the Pokhri, a flight of stone
staircases leads one to a beautiful forest trail ultimately leading to
the Rinchenpong Monastery. Fluttering prayer flags and young lamas
welcome you to the monastery, which also doubles up as a lama-training
centre. Built in 1717 the monastery contains a rare idol of Ati Buddha
in Yub-Yum position, which shows Buddha in meditating position with a
woman embracing him.</span><br style="color: yellow;">
<span style="color: yellow;">Bidding farewell to
Rinchenpong Monastery, follow a jungle tra</span><span style="color: yellow;">il to a staircase leading to
the Resume Monastery. The steep stairs makes going difficult, but the
chirping and tweeting of birds and an occasional peek of snow peaks
gleaming through treetops are enough to charge your batteries. The
Resume Monastery, run by two young lamas, is in a rundown state, but
the monastery strategically</span><span style="color: yellow;"> located on a ridge top overlooking the
sleepy hamlet of Rinchenpong offers a grand view of the mountains.</span><img style="width: 122px; height: 91px;" alt="monastery" src="IMAGES/rinchenpong%20monastery.jpg"><br style="color: yellow;">
<span style="color: yellow;">After a short stop at
the monastery follow your steps downwards and take a short diversion to
the traditional Lapcha house. Built in original Lapcha style, the house
doubles up as an artifact shop. Get back to the trail and follow it to
the metal road. At the confluence of the steps and the metal road lies
the British Forest Bungalow. Today, maintained by the Sikkim PWD, the
bungalow has been</span><span style="color: yellow;">
modified and nothing much remains of its past. Follow the metal road
past the Poison Pokhri to the Rinchenpong bazaar, marking the end of a
three-hour long trek.After a quick bath and lunch we head out for Maggi
Dara, where a new monastery is being built. Next to the monastery lies
the Rabindra Smriti Van. A marble plaque containing a verse from the
Poet&#8217;s Gitanjali welcomes you to this reserve forest ideal for short
afternoon strolls. The evening can be spent exploring the bazaar. After
a night halt at the hotel and another glorious sunrise its time for
home.</span>
