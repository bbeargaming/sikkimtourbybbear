was once a transit point to the historic Silk Route from Tibet to
India. The silk route that connected Lhasa (Tibet) to Kalimpong was in
use even a few decades ago until the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It was
commonly used by traders traveling to Tibet through Jelep-la ("La"
stands for mountain pass) as an overnight base. The route started from
Kalimpong and passed through Pedong, Aritar, Dzuluk and Jelepla to
Chumbi valley in Tibet.</span><br style="font-family: Algerian; color: rgb(79, 244, 205);">
<br style="font-family: Algerian; color: rgb(79, 244, 205);">
<span style="font-family: Algerian; color: rgb(79, 244, 205);">Located
at a height of around 10,100 feet on the rugged terrain of the lower
Himalayas in East Sikkim, Zuluk or Dzuluk is a small village which was
once a transit point to the historic Silk Route from Tibet to India. It
is relatively an emerging and offbeat destination in East Sikkim. This
small village accommodates a population of around 700 people. There is
also an Indian Army base at Zuluk, which has been used as a transit
camp for the army movement to the Chinese border, a few kilometres
away. It is the very first village within this whole Silk Route circuit
to offer home-stay facilities for tourists. 14 kms away from Zuluk, the
Thambi View Point offers a panoramic view of the entire Mt.
Khangchendzonga range. Zuluk is open to Indian nationals only who need
to apply for Protected Area Permit.</span><br style="font-family: Algerian; color: rgb(79, 244, 205);">

virgin. Sighting of Deer, Wild Dog, Himalayan Bear the red panda is not

months, the area and its surrounding hills are covered with thousands

colors due to the variety of rhododendron that can be seen here.</span></td>
