people are motivated by the desire to learn new things and so are the
tourists. Engaging in experience educationally increases ones knowledge
about a product or service he wants to consume. As a result, he or she
will go for the best quality when looking for any commodity or
services.In
Sikkim, many tourist establishments provide&nbsp; the tourists with
tourist guidelines and brochures indicating the animals, activities and
people to expect in a given tourist establishment</span>

Lake, also known as Tsongmo Lake or Changu Lake, is a glacial lake in
the East Sikkim district of the Indian state of Sikkim, some 40
kilometres (25 mi) from the capital Gangtok. Located at an elevation of
3,753 m (12,313 ft), the lake remains frozen during the winter season.
The lake surface reflects different colours with change of seasons and
is held in great reverence by the local Sikkimese people. Buddhist
monks prognosticated after studying the changing colours of the
lake.After the winter season ends in middle of May, the periphery of
lake has scenic blooms of flower species of rhododendrons (the state
tree of Sikkim), primulas, blue and yellow poppies, irises and so
forth. Also seen in the precincts of the lake are several species of
birds including Brahminy ducks. Wildlife seen includes the red panda.<br>

Monastery is situated at the giddying height of 5,500ft. The third
oldest monastery in Sikkim is perched on a mountain trail and offers a
brilliant view of the Kanchenjunga. Besides the picturesque location,
this gompa has a statue one doesn&#8217;t find in most other monasteries- Ati
Buddha seated in the Yab-Yum position. For nearly three centuries, this
monastery has been part of Rinchenpong village and if you want to cover
the heritage circuit of Sikkim, there&#8217;s no way you can skip this
one.Everywhere
in Sikkim, the beauty of a monastery is somehow heightened by the
village. Rinchenpong is a quaint little hamlet above which sits the
gompa. Geographically well-endowed, this village offers a stupendous
view of the Kanchenjunga and other mountains of the Himalayan range. As
one takes the trail that leads up to the gompa, bounded by towering
prayer flags flapping in the wind, one understands the perfect union of
ancient structures and nature in Sikkim.<br><br>FOLLOWING IS A LINK FOR A WEBPAGE DEVELOPED BY ME WHICH TELL ABOUT RINCHENPONG MONASTERY IN DETAIL:<a href="RinchennpongMonastery.html">More info about Rinchenpong</a></span><span style="font-family: Bodoni MT Black; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"></span><span style="font-family: Bodoni MT Black; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"></span><span style="font-family: Bodoni MT Black; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"></span></div>
